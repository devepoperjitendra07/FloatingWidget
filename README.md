# FloatingWidget

Back in 2014, during Google I/O, Google announced a new visual language called Material Design. This language was announced with guides to help Android developers create user experience that work well on different devices, with different input methods, and on different platforms.

In 2015 Google I/O, Google announced their new Android Design Support Library including Floating Action Button. This means, now developers won’t have to create Android Floating Action Button from scratch.

In fact, Android Floating Action Button is a good option to start converting existing applications into new version of Android. Though, there are many ways you might apply this new pattern incorrectly, which is why in this Android app tutorial, we’ll show you [how to implement Floating Action Button](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-floating-action-button-android-example/) with new Android Design Support Library.

Although, there is a lot more in the Material Design, and if your startup Android app is outdated or needs a reskin, hire [Android app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to apply Material Design patterns in your Android application to give a new look.
